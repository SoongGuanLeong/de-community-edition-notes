** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thanks for the clear and well-structured submission. You’ve covered the core requirements and presented them in an easy-to-scan Markdown format. Below is detailed feedback aligned to the rubric, plus concrete suggestions to strengthen the package.

What’s working well
- Clarity and structure: The ownership table is clear and complete for all five pipelines. The on-call rotation is simple and fair in intent. The investor-facing runbooks list owners, upstreams, downstreams, common issues, and SLAs—good coverage.
- Relevance: You correctly limited runbooks to investor-reporting pipelines, as required. Including upstream and downstream stakeholders shows thoughtful consideration of dependencies and consumers.
- SLAs: Time-based SLAs with quantified expectations are included for each investor pipeline, which is critical for investor reporting.

Gaps and opportunities to improve
1) Ownership assignments
- Balance and rationale: One engineer (A) is the primary for two pipelines while the others have one each. That can be fine, but a brief rationale (expertise alignment) helps show intentional load distribution. Consider rotating primary roles on experimental pipelines quarterly.
- Contact and escalation: Add contact channels (Slack group, PagerDuty service) and clarify escalation (e.g., secondary owner, then data eng lead).

2) On-call schedule and fairness
- Coverage scope: Clarify whether the on-call engineer covers all five pipelines or only investor pipelines. If all, spell out priority order during incidents.
- Coverage windows: Define hours, time zone, and weekend coverage explicitly. The SLAs imply morning UTC deadlines—be explicit about checks, especially around weekend/holiday mornings.
- Handoffs and transitions:
  - Add a handoff checklist (open incidents, suppressions, failing tasks, muted alerts, known upstream incidents).
  - Document a backup/secondary on-call each week in case the primary is unavailable.
  - Maintain a holiday calendar and pre-approve swaps two weeks in advance to avoid last-minute gaps. “Swap with next person” can cause bunching; consider a backup bench or a documented swap protocol.
- Paging rules: Define severity levels and paging paths (e.g., Sev1 page at any time for investor pipelines; Sev2 during business hours).

3) Runbook completeness for investor pipelines
The assignment asks for pipeline name and purpose, types of data processed, owners, common issues, SLAs, and on-call procedures. You are missing:
- Purpose: Add a one-line description of business use and how the metric is defined at a high level. This helps new on-call engineers and downstream stakeholders.
- Types of data processed: Enumerate major tables/streams and grain (e.g., transactions at invoice_id grain, subscription lifecycle events at customer_id-day).
- On-call procedures: Provide actionable steps without prescribing solutions:
  - Where alerts fire (PagerDuty service, Slack channel), dashboards to check, what logs to review, quick triage queries, and when to escalate to upstreams.
  - Run frequency and orchestrator (e.g., Airflow DAG daily at 01:00 UTC, dbt models build order). Include the storage targets (warehouse schema/tables).
  - Backfill guidance: allowed window, safe re-run boundaries, and who must approve.
  - Data quality checks and thresholds that map to the SLA (freshness, completeness, referential integrity). Include how these SLIs are computed and what constitutes a breach.
  - Change management: where schema changes are proposed/approved, and a link to the data contract if one exists.

4) SLA precision and testability
- Define metrics: “Accuracy within 1% of Finance DB” is ambiguous. Specify how measured (e.g., absolute delta between warehouse revenue_total and finance.booked_revenue_total at T-1 close, tolerance 1%).
- Completeness and ingestion percentages: Define the denominator and measurement window (e.g., number of expected user activity events by partition date, sourced from event_count_expected table).
- Alert thresholds: Map SLAs to alerting thresholds (warning vs critical), and include acceptable grace periods if upstreams are known to lag.

5) Coverage of non-investor pipelines
- While not required to have detailed runbooks, brief stubs for the experimental pipelines would improve operational readiness (purpose, schedule, where to check health, and how incidents affect investor-facing outputs, if at all).

6) Minor formatting and consistency
- Use consistent terms (on-call vs oncall). Use “by 06:00 UTC” for SLA clarity. Consider adding links/IDs for owners (e.g., Slack handles) if this were a real environment.

Targeted suggestions and example additions
- Add purpose and data types to each investor pipeline. Example for Aggregate Profit:
  - Purpose: Report company-wide daily profit to Finance and Investor Relations using booked revenue minus recognized costs.
  - Types of data: Invoices and credit notes (invoice_id grain), cost-of-goods-sold allocations (accounting_period_id), payroll allocations (team_id-month), adjustments (journal_entry_id).
- Add on-call procedure snippet for Aggregate Growth:
  - Alerts: PagerDuty service “growth-investor”; warning if freshness > 5h, critical if > 7h.
  - Dashboards: Looker “Growth Investor Daily” and Airflow DAG “agg_growth_investor”.
  - Triage: Check Airflow run status, verify data freshness for subscription_renewals, churn_events. If upstream lag from Subscription Services > 60 minutes, page their on-call via “subsrvs-oncall” Slack.
  - Escalation: If not green by 06:30 UTC, page secondary owner; at 07:00 UTC, notify Investor Relations in “#investor-metrics” with status template.

What you can add to remedy the submission
- For each investor pipeline:
  - Purpose/business definition and metric grain.
  - Types of data processed and storage locations.
  - On-call procedures: alert sources, dashboards, triage steps, severity levels, escalation contacts.
  - Run schedule/orchestrator and backfill rules.
  - Concrete SLI definitions and how they’re calculated.
- For on-call:
  - Coverage hours/time zone, weekend policy, backup on-call, handoff checklist, and a holiday calendar approach.
  - Explicit scope of responsibility per rotation (which pipelines, priority).
- Optional but valuable: Data contracts or schema versioning notes, dependency diagrams/links.

Overall assessment
- You met the core requirements and demonstrated solid operational thinking with upstream/downstream mapping and sensible SLAs. The main misses are the absence of purpose/data types and on-call procedures in each runbook, plus some precision gaps in SLAs and on-call coverage details. Addressing those would elevate this to an A-level submission.
