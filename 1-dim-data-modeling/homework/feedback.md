**Feedback**

You've done a commendable job with your SQL scripts! Let’s dive into each file to evaluate your work:

**1.sql:**
- You’ve defined custom types 'film_stats' and 'quality_class' efficiently. This enhances your data structure and facilitates easier handling of complex operations.
- The `actors` table design is well-constructed with appropriate use of data types, and setting `actorid` and `year` as a composite primary key ensures data integrity.

**2.sql and 2b.sql:**
- You’ve used recursive insertion to populate the `actors` table from 1969 to 2021. It's good to see the use of window functions and aggregation logic to manage actor records over the years.
- Aggregating film stats and handling NULL cases with COALESCE and conditional expressions demonstrate a good understanding of SQL operations.

**4.sql:**
- Using `LAG()` to get previous values and establishing change indicators for quality class and activity status is very effective for historical state tracking.
- The streak identification through `SUM()` and partitioning ensures continuous states get grouped correctly, showcasing complex SQL handling.

**5.sql:**
- You’ve employed a series of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to generate a comprehensive view of the historical data and its transformation into the current state.
- The use of set operations like `UNION ALL` to integrate unchanged, changed, and new records makes your query readable and maintainable.

**3.sql:**
- The SCD table is designed with an appropriate structure to track changes over time correctly. 

**General Feedback:**
- Readability: Your SQL scripts are organized, with clear logic flow and use of meaningful aliases, which enhances readability.
- Best practices: You've implemented good SQL practices such as use of CTEs for simplifying complex queries and window functions for advanced analytics.
- Indexes: You’ve utilized an index in at least one script, enhancing query performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Comments: Adding more inline comments would improve maintainability and readability for others who might read or modify your code.
- Error Handling: Consider potential errors or edge cases that might occur and implement error handling or validation checks for robust scripts.
- Testing: Ensure to test your queries for performance, especially given the size and complexity of the operations.

Overall, your SQL logic and structure demonstrate a good understanding of database operations and advanced SQL features.

**FINAL GRADE:**
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Great work! Keep honing your skills and consider the suggestions for further improvement.
