Thanks for a strong, thoughtful submission. You clearly understand LinkedIn’s core value props and designed three relevant, impactful experiments with sensible objectives, metrics, and guardrails. Below is targeted feedback to help you strengthen experimental rigor and decision-readiness.

High-level strengths
- Clear hypotheses tied to real user value: better matches for networking, timely jobs, and surfacing skills to drive professional interactions.
- Solid experiment scaffolding: randomization unit, eligibility, exposure, primary/secondary/guardrail metrics, duration, MDE, and segmentation.
- Practical guardrails and fairness considerations, especially in Experiment 1.

Key areas to improve across all experiments
- Test cell allocation: Specify exact splits (e.g., 50/50 or 45/45/10 with a global holdout). Without this, power and execution planning are unclear.
- Leading vs lagging metrics: You have both, but they’re not consistently labeled. Tag them explicitly so you can read early directional signals vs durable outcomes.
- ITT vs exposure conditioning: Several exposure definitions condition on post-treatment behavior (e.g., “opened at least once”). Use ITT for the primary analysis; use exposure-based cuts as secondary analyses.
- Baselines, power, and decision rules: Provide baseline metric levels, alpha/power assumptions (e.g., 0.05, 80%), tails, and a clear “ship/no-ship” decision rule that references guardrails.
- Interference/network effects: LinkedIn is a networked product. Call out any potential cross-unit interference and mitigations (e.g., cluster randomization or sensitivity checks).
- Instrumentation readiness: Briefly note the events you will log and how you’ll attribute outcomes (per suggestion, per session, per user).

User journey feedback
- Strong, credible story with concrete touchpoints (recruiter InMail, People You May Know, endorsements, courses). To improve:
  - Add timeline and behavior shift: what changed from years 1–2 vs 4–5?
  - Quantify current usage habits (e.g., weekly sessions, % of sessions with job search vs networking).
  - Mention pain points or friction; these often motivate experiments and align KPIs with user value.

Experiment 1: Personalized Networking Suggestions vs. Generic
What’s great
- Objective and feature signals are well-scoped.
- Sensible guardrails and fairness checks included.
- Primary metric is outcome-focused (accepts), not just clicks.

Suggestions
- Test cells: Define allocation (e.g., 50% control, 50% treatment), and whether you’ll run multiple personalization variants (e.g., different weightings).
- Primary metric definition: “Accepted connection requests per 1k suggestions shown” is solid, but also track per-user acceptance rate and invites sent to ensure you’re not just increasing volume.
- Quality outcomes (lagging): Add message reply rate, 14/30-day conversation starts, new connection retention, and report/mute/ignore rates tied to invites.
- ITT: Use user assignment regardless of suggestion exposure as primary; analyze exposure-adjusted results secondarily.
- Interference: Personalized suggestions may alter who gets invited (affecting others’ experience). Call out a sensitivity check or cluster by ego-network if feasible.
- Fairness: Specify how you’ll measure disparate impact (e.g., relative lift by gender/region/school tier) and define acceptable deltas.
- Algorithm change management: Fix candidate sets and weights during the test; avoid mid-test tuning that invalidates inference.
- Sample size: Add baseline acceptance rate and compute required N for your MDE range.

Experiment 2: Job Recommendation Notifications — Daily vs Weekly
What’s great
- Objective is clear and practical. Guardrails cover unsubscribes/spam and fatigue.
- Segmentation acknowledges active vs passive seekers.

Suggestions
- Add a holdout cell: Consider three cells: daily, weekly, and 0 notifications to estimate absolute lift and cannibalization of organic discovery. Example split: 40/40/20.
- Primary metric and quality: Track applications completed, conversion to recruiter contact/interview, and downstream job outcome proxies. “Applications started” can inflate without quality.
- ITT: Do not condition on “opened at least once.” Use send eligibility under randomization as exposure; opens/clicks are diagnostic.
- Fatigue and retention: Add 7/14-day retention, DAU/WAU, and per-user notification cap across all sources to avoid overload.
- Timing controls: Ensure consistent send-time policies between cells. If using send-time optimization, keep the same model across cells or freeze send times to isolate frequency effect.
- Seasonality: Prefer 6 weeks to cover weekly cycles and recruiting season effects.
- Deliverability: Track email bounces, spam complaint rate, and domain-level reputation as guardrails.

Experiment 3: Highlight Skill Endorsements in Feed
What’s great
- Clear module and outcome path to profile engagement.
- Good guardrails for feed quality.

Suggestions
- Randomization unit: Viewer-level is fine—make it sticky per viewer and device, and confirm assignment at request time to avoid cross-device leakage.
- Primary metric hierarchy: CTR is a good leading metric. Define success on downstream outcomes: profile views, endorsements given, connection requests, message starts, and 7/14-day follow-up interactions. Use CTR as diagnostic.
- Position bias: Control for feed position. Consider ghost insertions/counterfactual ranking to separate module intrinsic value from ranking placement.
- Creator fairness: Ensure you don’t over-amplify high-endorsement profiles. Add distributional checks across cohorts (seniority, industry, geography).
- Latency and displacement: Track P95 latency, ad displacement/monetization impact, and feed content diversity as guardrails.
- MDE adequacy: For a small module, 5–8% CTR lift may be ambitious. Calibrate against baseline CTR and sample to ensure power.

Typos/clarity nits to fix
- colleagues (not colleages), connection (not conenction), unsubscribe (not unsubcribe), dwell (not dweel), Endorsements (not Endorsemnts), button (not buttion), connections (not connecitons).
- Add spaces after parentheses in headings and ensure consistent capitalization for metric names.

What to add to remedy the submission
- Exact cell allocations for each experiment (e.g., 50/50; or 40/40/20 with a holdout).
- Baseline values for primary metrics and calculated sample sizes with alpha, power, and sidedness.
- Explicit leading vs lagging tags for each metric and the ship/no-ship decision rule referencing guardrails.
- ITT definition for each test and how you’ll use exposure-based analyses secondarily.
- Interference risk assessment and any clustering or sensitivity checks.
- Brief instrumentation plan: event names, attribution windows, and deduping logic.

Overall assessment
This is a high-quality submission with strong practical instincts. With clearer allocation, ITT framing, baseline/power math, and explicit decision rules, it would be experiment-ready.
