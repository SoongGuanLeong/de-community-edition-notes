**Feedback on Submission**

1. **Disabling Broadcast Joins (Query 1)**
   - Correctly disabled the default behavior of automatic broadcast joins using `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")` in `config.py`.

2. **Explicit Broadcast Joins (Query 2)**
   - Broadcast joins for the `maps` and `medals` tables have been implemented correctly in the `pipeline.py` using the `broadcast` function.

3. **Bucket Joins (Query 3)**
   - The tables `match_details`, `matches`, and `medals_matches_players` were correctly bucketed on `match_id` with 16 buckets, and bucket joins have been implemented in `pipeline.py`. The implementation of writing as a bucketed table and fallbacks using Iceberg is correctly placed in the `io_utils.py`.

4. **Aggregate Queries (Queries 4a-4d)**
   - **Query 4a (player_avg_kills):** Correctly calculates the highest average kills per game for players using aggregations and ordering by descending kills.
   - **Query 4b (playlist_counts):** Correctly computes the most played playlists by counting distinct matches per playlist.
   - **Query 4c (map_counts):** Correctly identifies the most frequently played maps by counting distinct matches.
   - **Query 4d (map_killingspree_medals_counts):** Correctly determines which map has the highest number of Killing Spree medals.

5. **Data Size Optimization (Query 5)**
   - Successfully experimented with different partition strategies and sorting within the partitions using `.sortWithinPartitions`.
   - Appropriately used different fields for partitioning and sorting, and experimented with multiple versions.

6. **Coding Practices and Efficiency**
   - Code is cleanly structured, and the logic is separated well across files (`main.py`, `pipeline.py`, `queries.py`, and `io_utils.py`).
   - Efficient use of Spark SQL functionalities is evident.
   - The Iceberg fallback was properly considered, indicating robustness in handling different environments.

7. **Output Verification**
   - Attempted to verify data size optimizations using Spark SQL commands which count files and sum file sizes, showing practical testing of optimization results.

**Areas for Improvement**
- The submission could include additional comments for clarity, especially in more complex sections like the bucketing logic and aggregation queries.
- Unit tests or sample data tests could help in validating query outputs reliably.

Overall, the submission met all assignment requirements correctly and efficiently.
