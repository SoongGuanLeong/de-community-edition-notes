Thank you for your submission. I'll evaluate your work based on the criteria provided in the assignment brief.

### Review Summary:

1. **Backfill Query Conversion:**
   - You have effectively converted the PostgreSQL backfill query for `actors_history_scd` into a SparkSQL query, as observed in `job1.py`. The conversion is accurate, leveraging `LAG` and `SUM` window functions to implement the transformation logic for maintaining Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).

2. **PySpark Job:**
   - **`job1.py`:** 
     - The `do_actors_history_scd_transformation` function accurately translates the logic for SCD transformation into a PySpark job. The creation of temporary tables and execution using SparkSQL is properly implemented.
   - **`job2.py`:**
     - The `do_users_bitcount_transformation` function contains an accurate implementation of the users bit count transformation logic for determining monthly, weekly, and daily activity. Using `BIT_COUNT` alongside masking operations is a clever approach.

3. **Tests:**
   - **`test_1.py`:**
     - The test for `do_actors_history_scd_transformation` well-implements the validation for the SCD logic using mock data. 
     - The expected outcomes are logically consistent with the transformation specified and showcase the capability to detect SCD changes.
   - **`test_2.py`:**
     - The test for `do_users_bitcount_transformation` utilizes mock data effectively to validate the calculations for monthly, weekly, and daily activity bit counts.
     - The use of `chispa` for dataframe comparisons is a good practice for asserting equality of dataframes.

### Areas of Improvement:

- **Comments and Documentation:**
  - Consider adding comments within the code to explain complex operations, particularly around window functions and bit manipulation. Even concise inline comments can make your code more maintainable.
  
- **Efficiency Recommendations:**
  - Ensure that your Spark jobs leverage lazy evaluation efficiently by limiting actions that force execution until necessary. 
  - Checkpointing or caching intermediate results that are reused might also improve performance, though it seems your current implementation does not require it due to the query's structure.

Overall, you've met the core requirements of converting PostgreSQL queries to SparkSQL, creating PySpark jobs, and implementing tests with expected outputs. Both the logic and functionality align with the assignment expectations.

### Final Evaluation:

You have successfully demonstrated the correct transformation of SQL queries and the development of PySpark jobs with accompanying tests that ensure data quality and correctness. Well done!
