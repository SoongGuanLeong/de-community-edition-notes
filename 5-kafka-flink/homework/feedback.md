### Feedback

#### 1. **Flink Job Correctness:**

- **Sessionization Logic:**
  - Your Flink job correctly implements sessionization by using a 5-minute gap with the `Session` window on `ip` and `host`. This is evident in `homework_job.py` where sessionization is handled with `Session.with_gap(lit(5).minutes)`.
  
- **Data Sink:**
  - The job writes the sessionized data into a PostgreSQL table named `processed_events_sessionized`, as expected.

#### 2. **SQL Query Correctness:**

- **Average Calculation:**
  - The SQL script accurately calculates the average number of web events per session for users on Tech Creator by using the `AVG(num_events)` function.
  
- **Host Comparison:**
  - The query correctly compares the average number of events between the specified hosts: `zachwilson.techcreator.io`, `zachwilson.tech`, and `lulu.techcreator.io`.

#### 3. **Code Quality:**

- **Readability and Structure:**
  - The Flink job scripts (`homework_job.py`) and (`start_job.py`) are well-structured. Your use of functions to encapsulate the logic for creating sources and sinks is commendable.
  
- **UDF Implementation:**
  - In `start_job.py`, the `GetLocation` UDF is a nice touch for enhancing the geolocation data within the processed events, although it's not directly related to this assignment.

#### 4. **Testing Instructions:**

- You did not provide explicit instructions for running and testing the Flink job and SQL query.
  - Consider providing a README or instructions to run `homework_job.py`, and explain how to use the `query.sql` for querying the results.

#### 5. **Documentation:**

- You provided the necessary files but did not include any additional documentation such as a README or comments in the code to explain the purpose of each function or component.
  - Adding comments and documentation will help others understand your implementation better and is a good practice for maintainability.

#### **Recommendations for Improvement:**

- **Add Documentation:**
  - Documenting your workflows, especially on how to test and execute them, can be a valuable addition.
  
- **Instructions for Testing:**
  - Clearly specify the steps for initiating the Flink job and running SQL queries would be a good practice.

#### **Conclusion:**

Overall, you've met the requirements by creating a correct Flink job for sessionizing web events and writing SQL that accurately computes requested metrics. Please bear in mind the importance of documenting and providing testing instructions to enhance usability and clarity.
