# Visualization

## Types of impact
- Measurable
    - efficiency improvement & experimentation outcomes
- Hard to measure
    - quality improvement & team enablement
- Immeasurable
    - changing intuition, team culture enablement, being a 'glue' person

## how does your effort as DE translate into value
- supply insights
- prevent bug & maintain data trust
- increase pipeline efficiency
- enable others to work faster
- persuading decision makers to use data

### When an insight is valuable
- When:
    - Reinforce intuition
    - Contradict intuition
    - Fail to support or contradict intuition
        - e.g. IT IS FOUND that X & Y is not correlated at all.
- Supply insights is often overvalued

#### Sign company is overvaluing insights
- 'crisis' happens
- you feel burnt out
- no more long-term planning
- AD HOC REQUEST HELL

#### What should you do in that situation
- be ready to say no
- leverage your manager for support
- communicate robust pipelines are better than one-off pipelines

### how to maintain data trust
- quality checks
- documentations
- good engineering practices
- clear expectations (SLAs, documented gaps)
- This type of value is often UNDERVALUED because it's harder to measure

### how to increase pipeline efficiencies
- proper data modeling
- improving oncall processes (failure handling)
- reduce data volumes
- picking the right tool for the job
- simplify model and reduce capabilities a little bit
