Hello,

Thank you for your submission. Let's review each part of your assignment:

### Query 1 Review:
Your query for tracking players’ state changes is well-structured and logical. The approach of iterating through each season and applying a FULL OUTER JOIN between current and previous season players is a solid strategy to identify state changes. The use of a CASE statement to determine the player's status effectively addresses the problem requirements. However, ensure that you are capturing the correct starting season and that your calculated "years_since_last_active" is handled accurately in logical conditions.

### Query 2 Review:
You correctly implemented `GROUPING SETS` to aggregate `game_details`. The query effectively groups dimensions based on player-team, player-season, and team-level data. Ensure that all records are correctly aggregated individually in their respective grouping to maintain accuracy during summations.

### Queries 3, 4, and 5 Review:
These queries provide the correct ordinal results for: 
- The player who scored the most points for a single team.
- The player who scored the most points in a single season.
- The team that has won the most games.
The commented lines appear to supply test results, which is useful for ensuring correctness.

### Query 6 Review:
The query calculating the most games a team has won in a 90-game stretch is excellent. The use of window functions in this scenario is appropriate, and the ordering within the windowing function is essential for accuracy. This ensures that you are correctly capturing the running sum of wins within the specified stretch.

### Query 7 Review:
The query for calculating LeBron James’s longest scoring streak over 10 points is well-done. The logic of breaking the streak using a "reset group" based on the condition of scoring 10 points is efficient, and the final selection of the maximum streak using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` ensures an accurate result.

### Overall Feedback:
1. **Correctness**: Your queries mostly adhere to the task requirements and seem to produce the correct results.
2. **Efficiency**: The use of window functions and `GROUPING SETS` is optimal for respective tasks and should handle large datasets effectively.
3. **Clarity**: The queries are well-structured and commented for clarity.
4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure handling missing or unexpected data inputs in the dataset properly.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Remember to validate that your queries also handle exceptions and do not rely on static inputs for stated conclusions.
- Consider checking for the first year of a player's activity when setting `years_since_last_active` for more nuanced state changes.
- Try to include explanations or comments before each logical section of your SQL logic to further improve readability and maintainability.

### FINAL GRADE:
```json

    "letter_grade": "A",
    "passes": true

Overall, excellent work! Keep honing these skills as they are highly valuable in data engineering tasks. If you have further questions or require clarifications, feel free to ask.
